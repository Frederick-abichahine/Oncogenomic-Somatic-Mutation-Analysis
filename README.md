## Goal  

To detect and interpret the potential clinical relevance of somatic genomic aberrations harboured in
the genome of an oncologic patient.

## Introduction  

Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, arising from both inherited and somatic mutations that drive uncontrolled cell growth and malignant transformation [1]. These alterations range from single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) to large chromosomal rearrangements and identifying them is crucial for understanding tumor biology and designing targeted therapies [2]. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized cancer genome analysis by enabling researchers to distinguish between inherited (germline) and tumor-specific (somatic) mutations through comparison of matched c and tumor DNA samples [3]. This study employs an integrated bioinformatics pipeline to analyze paired control and tumor samples from a single patient, aiming to identify somatic mutations and structural genomic changes that may underlie tumor progression and reveal potential therapeutic targets.
